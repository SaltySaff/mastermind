# Mastermind - A Ruby Project

## Introduction
This is my second project using Ruby and my second project utilizing OOP principles. The purpose of this project is to further cement my knowledge of OOP and Ruby.

## Overview
The main challenge of this project is to program the game Mastermind, despite my relative lack of knowledge about the game. I have played it in the past but not in a long time. Another challenge is to implement it in a way that it can be played from the terminal, which will test both my programming and problem-solving skills.
