# mastermind

This will be my second project using Ruby, and my second project utilizing OOP principles. I hope this project will allow me to further cement my knowledge of OOP, and further cement my Ruby skills in general.

The main challenge I forsee in programming Mastermind is first of all my relative lack of knowledge about the game - I have played it in the past, but not in a long time - and also implementing it in a way that it can be played from the terminal. I feel like this will challenge both my programming skills and my problem solving skills, and should prove to be a great way to implement what I have learned so far through the Odin Project.
